# Simulation of a superfluid

We make an introduction to the superfluidity phenomenon, focusing on the particular case
of helium-II, dealing with the basics of Bose-Einstein condensation for a better understanding.
We comment and justify the unique properties of He-II, by performing our own simulation of
the superfluid in which we observe some of these behaviors and drawing conclusions.

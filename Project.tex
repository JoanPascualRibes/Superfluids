\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Helium-II}
One of the most important properties of helium is that it cannot freeze at ambient pressure (25 atmospheres are required). It remains liquid for near-zero temperatures. The explanation for this unique behavior lies in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which gains importance for atoms with low mass and low potential, which perfectly matches the lightest of the noble gases.
\\

Pioneers in cryogenics were interested in the problem of minimizing the temperature of helium. The first to liquefy helium at 4.2 K was Heike Kamerlingh in 1908. A couple of years later, he realized that below 2.17 K the violent boiling process disappeared radically, although there is still phase change to vapor. The disappearance of the bubbles implies that there is no longer an irregular temperature distribution in the liquid. Now, if we place an electrical resistor in the helium below 2.17 K, it will dissipate the heat efficiently enough so that no bubbles appear. 
\\

This new state of helium became known as “Helium-II”. Willem Hendrik discovered that Helium-II was the best thermal conductor of all known materials, capable of flattening any thermal gradient. 
\\

On the other hand, Kamerlingh Onnes and Leo Dana found that cooling was more difficult near the transition because of the sudden increase in specific heat. The silhouette of the specific heat peak gave the phase change between Helium-II and Helium-I its name: the lambda transition, which is the sharpest phase transition known to us. This result can be related to conclusions from the study of the specific heat of Bose gases near Bose-Einstein condensate temperatures.
\\

\subsection{Superflow}

It was not until 1938 that the most important property of He-II was revealed.
Researchers Jack Allen and Donald Misener, on the one hand, and Pjotr Kapitza, on the other, conducted experiments on the flow of He-II to conclude that it can flow without viscosity.It turns out that at temperatures below the lambda temperature, this substance presents (with current experiments) no difficulty in passing through capillaries of the order of nanometers. This phenomenon was named superfluidity. The ideal fluid behavior adds to the arguments in favor of He-II having a Bose condensate of He atoms.
\\

We could conclude that this phenomenon is due to the disappearance of viscosity.However, the nature is not so simple.Experimentally, using a viscometer, a gradual (not sudden) drop in viscosity is observed starting at $T_\lambda$.

The first macroscopic models of superfluid helium-4 were
proposed by Tisza. His final model consists of four evolution equations, namely, the continuity equation, balance of momentum, evolution of superfluid velocity, and entropy balance. However, the model has several limitations. First, it does not allow for non-zero superfluid vorticity (quantum vortices). 

The Landau-Tisza model is formulated in terms of fice quantities (superfluid density $\rho_s$, normal density $\rho_n$, superfluid velocity $v_s$, normal velocity $v_n$ and entropy density $s$. Since we have more variables than equations we set a depencence onf the ratio $\rho_n/\rho$ on temperature. But this goes against the nature of superfluid helium-4, which is a single fluid with two motions, as expressed by Landau: “It must be particularly stressed that we
have here no real division of the particles of the liquid into ‘superfluid’
and ‘normal’ ones….”

# SUPERFLUIDS: Fritz London

## Introduction: Superfluid 
According to classical theory, at sufficiently low temperatures, any system composed of identical particles confined to a given column should come to rest.

According to quantum theory, the most stable of any system is a kind of kinetic equilibrium for so-called zero point motion characterized by the minimum average 
Total (potential + kinetic) energy under the supplementary connection of Heisemberf inequality.

The existence of superfluid and in particular the strange transfer mechanism they exhibit are direct indications that they represent macroscopic system for which the classical 
Theory is incompetent and that presumably quantum mechanisms are relevant to their constitution as a whole.

In 1924 Einstein, generalizing the ideas of the Indian physics Bose, developed the concept of a gas of identical molecules where two cases of A here B there and A there B here 
Are indistinguishable and one single case indeed. Theis preference would least, at a well-defined temperature, to a kind of change of state of aggregation where the molecules 
Would "condese" into the lowest quantum state, the state of momentum zero.

Manifested by a breaking in the specific heat curve $C_{V}$ at a well-defined "critical temperature $T_ {0} $. At this temperature, the mean thermal (kinetic) energý becomes so 
Small thtat the mean deBroglie wavelength $\lambda = h/p$ assumes a value of the order of the minimum molecular distance. When the temperature is lowered below the is critical 
Temperature $T_0$ the velocity distribution becomes inhomogeneous. A finite fraction of all molecules are assembled in the lowest quantum state (p=0) and accordingly has a 
microscopically large deBRoglie wave length while the rest of the molecules have a velocity distribution similar to that of a gas. The fraction of molecules in the lowers 
State increases with decreasing temperature until, at 0º absolute, all molecules are assembled in this particular state.

In superconductors as well as in superfluid helium, we enconter an equilibrium between two fluids which mutually interpenetrate in ordinary space but are in general separated 
in momentum space. 

It has been maintained that certain actions betewwen macromolecules in biochemistry could not be undesetood unless could be conceivec as conditioned by some quantum mechanism 
involving the system as a whole. Of course it is conceivable that in some biological process the concept of a fluid state of entropy zero could play a decisive role, because 
the quantum phenomena gives the possibility of stability with the possibility of motion without implying dissipation process.

## Remarkable properties of liquid helium.

In 1908 Kamerlingh Onnes liquefied helium (critical temperature 5.2ºK). He found that when the liqueid is cooled below 2.2ºK it starts expanding insted of continuing to contract,
thus deviating from the behaviour of more substances.
In 1924 Onnes and Boks found that the densiry-temperature funciton has a sharp maximum with a discontinuty of thus slope at that temperature. 
In 1928 Keeson and Wolke were first to use terminology "helium I" and "helium II" suggesting the idea of a kind of allotropic modification. In contrast to ordinary phase transitions,
the transition from He II to H2 I is not accompanied by a latent heat.
In 1932 Specific heat measurements by Keesom and Clusius showed a singularity of the specific heat curve whose characteristic profile, resembling the shape of the letter lambda,
has given rise to the name $\lambda$-point. Lambda-point occur in many substances and are characterized by vanishing latent heat and the above-mentioned sort of singulariry of 
specific heat.

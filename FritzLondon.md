# SUPERFLUIDS: Fritz London

## Introduction: Superfluid 
According to classical theory, at sufficiently low temperatures, any system composed of identical particles confined to a given column should come to rest.

According to quantum theory, the most stable of any system is a kind of kinetic equilibrium for so-called zero point motion characterized by the minimum average 
Total (potential + kinetic) energy under the supplementary connection of Heisemberf inequality.

The existence of superfluid and in particular the strange transfer mechanism they exhibit are direct indications that they represent macroscopic system for which the classical 
Theory is incompetent and that presumably quantum mechanisms are relevant to their constitution as a whole.

In 1924 Einstein, generalizing the ideas of the Indian physics Bose, developed the concept of a gas of identical molecules where two cases of A here B there and A there B here 
Are indistinguishable and one single case indeed. Theis preference would least, at a well-defined temperature, to a kind of change of state of aggregation where the molecules 
Would "condese" into the lowest quantum state, the state of momentum zero.

Manifested by a breaking in the specific heat curve $C_{V}$ at a well-defined "critical temperature $T_ {0} $. At this temperature, the mean thermal (kinetic) energý becomes so 
Small thtat the mean deBroglie wavelength $\lambda = h/p$ assumes a value of the order of the minimum molecular distance. When the temperature is lowered below the is critical 
Temperature $T_0$ the velocity distribution becomes inhomogeneous. A finite fraction of all molecules are assembled in the lowest quantum state (p=0) and accordingly has a 
microscopically large deBRoglie wave length while the rest of the molecules have a velocity distribution similar to that of a gas. The fraction of molecules in the lowers 
State increases with decreasing temperature until, at 0º absolute, all molecules are assembled in this particular state.

In superconductors as well as in superfluid helium, we enconter an equilibrium between two fluids which mutually interpenetrate in ordinary space but are in general separated 
in momentum space. 

It has been maintained that certain actions betewwen macromolecules in biochemistry could not be undesetood unless could be conceivec as conditioned by some quantum mechanism 
involving the system as a whole. Of course it is conceivable that in some biological process the concept of a fluid state of entropy zero could play a decisive role, because 
the quantum phenomena gives the possibility of stability with the possibility of motion without implying dissipation process.

## Remarkable properties of liquid helium.

In 1908 Kamerlingh Onnes liquefied helium (critical temperature 5.2ºK). He found that when the liqueid is cooled below 2.2ºK it starts expanding insted of continuing to contract,
thus deviating from the behaviour of more substances.
In 1924 Onnes and Boks found that the densiry-temperature funciton has a sharp maximum with a discontinuty of thus slope at that temperature. 
In 1928 Keeson and Wolke were first to use terminology "helium I" and "helium II" suggesting the idea of a kind of allotropic modification. In contrast to ordinary phase transitions,
the transition from He II to H2 I is not accompanied by a latent heat.
In 1932 Specific heat measurements by Keesom and Clusius showed a singularity of the specific heat curve whose characteristic profile, resembling the shape of the letter lambda,
has given rise to the name $\lambda$-point. Lambda-point occur in many substances and are characterized by vanishing latent heat and the above-mentioned sort of singulariry of 
specific heat.

The most conspicuos pecularity of the diagram on P-T plane is the absence of a triple point between the solid, liquid and gaseous states. Instead are actually two triple points, at the ends of the $\lambda$-line which separates liquid He I from He II. Anether pecularity is that melting curve seem to approach T = 0 at a pressure of about 25 atm.

From the Clausius-Clapeyron equation $dP_m / dT =(S_{liq}-S_{sol})/(V_{liq}-V_{sol})$ where $P_m$ is the melting pressure curve, it follow that at 1ºK the entropy of the liquid must be practicall equal to entropy of the solid. Hence ir seem as if between 2.2ºK and 1ºK liquid helium loses all entropy characteristic of the disorder of the ordinary liquid state.

$\Delta U = T \Delta S - P_m \Delta V \qquad \Delta S = (dP_m/dT)\Delta V \quad \implies \quad \Delta U = T \left( dP_m / dT - P_m/T \right) \Delta V$ Which Implies if a point on the melting-pressure curve tangent can be drawn from $P=0$ $T=0$ $\left( \therefore \ dP_m / dT = P_m / T \right)$, the energy difference must change sign at the temperature of point of contact. For no other substance can such a tangent be contructed because ordinarily melting or sublimation curves start at 0ºK and are always convex toward the T axis. This means in general solid state is state of lowest energy.

Solid helium cannot be melted isothermally by supplying het to the system, since there is no heat of mealting. Close to absolute zero, solidificaciotn and melting are purely mechanical processes. No entropy change is involved in this trancition. At absolute zero, where the system is in its lowest (single) quantum state, melting must then consist in an adiabatic transformation of this quantum state.

Liquid helium can overcome obstacles freely even without requiring a noticeable preassure difference and it seems to leave its entropy behind. The fact that no entropy transfer in connected with the superfluid flow clearly indicates that no entropy transfer is connected with the superfluid flow clearly indicates that this flow is again a purely mechanical process. Ir appears then as if actually is this superfluid transfer process a single quantum state is adiabatically so transformed as to pass through the capillaries.

## Energy and structure of condensed helium at absolute zero

Let $\phi(r)$ be the potential of the force between two molecules which may be assumed to depend only on their separation r and to be independent of the presence of other molecules. Furthermore he N molecules are supposed to be enclosed in a volume V.

Classically, the most stable state would be where particles are at rest. Presumably be closed-packed lattice. In quantum mechanics the lowest state is given by minimum of the integral 
$E=\int_V \dots \int_V \ \ \frac{h^2}{8\pi^2 m} \Sigma_a \left(\nabla_a \Psi \cdot \nabla_a \Psi^{\ast}\right) + \Phi \Psi\Psi^{\ast} \ \ d^3 r_1 \dots d^3 r_N$. For all substances except helium the following mothed leads in general to a satisfactory approximation by considering harmonic oscillations $E_{min} = \Phi_0 + \frac{h}{2}\Sigma \nu_k$ where $\nu_k$ is the frecuency of normal modes. Of course this energy can be calculated only if the spectrum is known, for which emperical data is fitted. 

It would not be sensible to calculate the characteristic vibrational modes for the volume corresponding to the classical equilibrium positions, and then to determine the zero point vibrations of those modes, if the colume of the liquid is actually so much larger. Liquid helium may be visualized as held together by the attractive forces balanced merely by the zero point repulsion ( not merely by the Van der Waals repulsion), the atoms are floating so far apart from each other thtat the repulsive forces do not interlock as in ordinary liquids. It can be foreseen that this circumstances will be importat for explaining the fact that helium cannot be solidified merely by cooling.

Keesom and Taconis moda an X-ray analysis of liquid helium. For both liquid He I and He II a pattern typical of a liquid was found; it showed a single rather diffuse ring at a difraction angle on about 28º for a wave length 1.58 $\overset\circ A$. No difference between the patterns of the two forms of the liquid could be discerned. Keesom and Taconis tried to interpret their result by a radial distribution in which every atom has six nearest neighbors at a distance of about 3.16 $\overset\circ A = 2^{-1/6}(V/N)^{1/3}$. They showed that such a distribution could be represented by a peculiar structure: imagine a facecentered cubic lattice of density double that of the liquid if all its lattice points are filled, then remove from it half of the atoms in such a way that each atom is currounded by six atoms and six empty sites. The strucutre in question is a configuration of space group $T_d^2$.

# SUPERFLUIDS: Fritz London

## Introduction: Superfluid 
According to classical theory, at sufficiently low temperatures, any system composed of identical particles confined to a given column should come to rest.

According to quantum theory, the most stable of any system is a kind of kinetic equilibrium for so-called zero point motion characterized by the minimum average 
Total (potential + kinetic) energy under the supplementary connection of Heisemberf inequality.

The existence of superfluid and in particular the strange transfer mechanism they exhibit are direct indications that they represent macroscopic system for which the classical 
Theory is incompetent and that presumably quantum mechanisms are relevant to their constitution as a whole.

In 1924 Einstein, generalizing the ideas of the Indian physics Bose, developed the concept of a gas of identical molecules where two cases of A here B there and A there B here 
Are indistinguishable and one single case indeed. Theis preference would least, at a well-defined temperature, to a kind of change of state of aggregation where the molecules 
Would "condese" into the lowest quantum state, the state of momentum zero.

Manifested by a breaking in the specific heat curve $C_{V}$ at a well-defined "critical temperature $T_ {0} $. At this temperature, the mean thermal (kinetic) energý becomes so 
Small thtat the mean deBroglie wavelength $\lambda = h/p$ assumes a value of the order of the minimum molecular distance. When the temperature is lowered below the is critical 
Temperature $T_0$ the velocity distribution becomes inhomogeneous. A finite fraction of all molecules are assembled in the lowest quantum state (p=0) and accordingly has a 
microscopically large deBRoglie wave length while the rest of the molecules have a velocity distribution similar to that of a gas. The fraction of molecules in the lowers 
State increases with decreasing temperature until, at 0º absolute, all molecules are assembled in this particular state.

In superconductors as well as in superfluid helium, we enconter an equilibrium between two fluids which mutually interpenetrate in ordinary space but are in general separated 
in momentum space. 

It has been maintained that certain actions betewwen macromolecules in biochemistry could not be undesetood unless could be conceivec as conditioned by some quantum mechanism 
involving the system as a whole. Of course it is conceivable that in some biological process the concept of a fluid state of entropy zero could play a decisive role, because 
the quantum phenomena gives the possibility of stability with the possibility of motion without implying dissipation process.

## Remarkable properties of liquid helium.

In 1908 Kamerlingh Onnes liquefied helium (critical temperature 5.2ºK). He found that when the liqueid is cooled below 2.2ºK it starts expanding insted of continuing to contract,
thus deviating from the behaviour of more substances.
In 1924 Onnes and Boks found that the densiry-temperature funciton has a sharp maximum with a discontinuty of thus slope at that temperature. 
In 1928 Keeson and Wolke were first to use terminology "helium I" and "helium II" suggesting the idea of a kind of allotropic modification. In contrast to ordinary phase transitions,
the transition from He II to H2 I is not accompanied by a latent heat.
In 1932 Specific heat measurements by Keesom and Clusius showed a singularity of the specific heat curve whose characteristic profile, resembling the shape of the letter lambda,
has given rise to the name $\lambda$-point. Lambda-point occur in many substances and are characterized by vanishing latent heat and the above-mentioned sort of singulariry of 
specific heat.

The most conspicuos pecularity of the diagram on P-T plane is the absence of a triple point between the solid, liquid and gaseous states. Instead are actually two triple points, at the ends of the $\lambda$-line which separates liquid He I from He II. Anether pecularity is that melting curve seem to approach T = 0 at a pressure of about 25 atm.

From the Clausius-Clapeyron equation $dP_m / dT =(S_{liq}-S_{sol})/(V_{liq}-V_{sol})$ where $P_m$ is the melting pressure curve, it follow that at 1ºK the entropy of the liquid must be practicall equal to entropy of the solid. Hence ir seem as if between 2.2ºK and 1ºK liquid helium loses all entropy characteristic of the disorder of the ordinary liquid state.

$\Delta U = T \Delta S - P_m \Delta V \qquad \Delta S = (dP_m/dT)\Delta V \quad \implies \quad \Delta U = T \left( dP_m / dT - P_m/T \right) \Delta V$ Which Implies if a point on the melting-pressure curve tangent can be drawn from $P=0$ $T=0$ $\left( \therefore \ dP_m / dT = P_m / T \right)$, the energy difference must change sign at the temperature of point of contact. For no other substance can such a tangent be contructed because ordinarily melting or sublimation curves start at 0ºK and are always convex toward the T axis. This means in general solid state is state of lowest energy.

Solid helium cannot be melted isothermally by supplying het to the system, since there is no heat of mealting. Close to absolute zero, solidificaciotn and melting are purely mechanical processes. No entropy change is involved in this trancition. At absolute zero, where the system is in its lowest (single) quantum state, melting must then consist in an adiabatic transformation of this quantum state.
Even at finite temperatures, at which liquid helium II has some entropy, there is a very peculiar transfoer process by which at least a part of the liquid can slip through the finest cracks and extremely narrow slits and capillaries, which for normal liquids are, in effect, impassable. 

Liquid helium can overcome obstacles freely even without requiring a noticeable preassure difference and it seems to leave its entropy behind. The fact that no entropy transfer in connected with the superfluid flow clearly indicates that no entropy transfer is connected with the superfluid flow clearly indicates that this flow is again a purely mechanical process. Ir appears then as if actually is this superfluid transfer process a single quantum state is adiabatically so transformed as to pass through the capillaries.

### The "Super" properties of liquid helium II 

* **Thermal Superconductivity**
In 1936 Keesom and Miss Keesom noticed an enormous increase of heat exchange as liquid helium passes through the $\lambda$-point. 1937 Allen, Peierls and Uddin first noticed that the heat current is liquid helium II is not proportional to the temperature gradient (violating the Fourier Law). At any rate the heat current depend on the slit width in a way that rules out a description by a heat conductivity equation.
* **Superfluidity**
In 1930 Keesom and Van der Ende observed quite accidentally that liquid helium II passed with very annoying ease through ceration extremely small leaks which at a higher temperature were perfectly tight for liquid helium I and even for gaseous helium. In 1938 Keesom and Macwood measured the viscosity with the rotationg disk method and showed that the viscosity varies continuously, decreases with decreasing temperature quite considerably, and is certainly not very different from the viscosity of helium I. In 1938 Kapitza (and independetly Allen and Misener 1938) reported measuremets based on the capillary flow method which showed the viscosity of liquid helium dropping by many orders of magnitude to an immeasurably small value. These experiments certainly did not indicate the presence of a viscous, laminar or turbulnet flow. They cannot be discussed on the basis of the ordinary differential equation of hydrodynamics. 
* **The fountain effect**
In 1938 Allen and Jones study heat conductivity with a reservoir and a smaller vessel, both filled with liquid helium and connected by a fine capillary. When they supplied heat to the inner vessel, they observed that the inner helium level rose slightly above that of the reservoir. In one of their experiments thay used a tube with its lower end filled with emery powder. When they heated the powder by the radiation of a flashlight, they observed a jet of liquid helium rising from the upper end to a height of several centimeters. It seems impossible to treat the hydrodynamical and caloric properties of liquid helium independently, because even extremely small temperature differences between bath and inner vessel are sufficient to produce a very large convection.

* **Supersurface film**
In 1922 Onnes observed a transfer at a striking speed of helium from one vessel to the other until the levels is two containers had reached the same heigth. In 1939 Pollin and Simon observed that the rate of evaporation of liquid contained in a vessel increased suddenly when the temperature is lowered below $\lambda$-point. They suggested that this migth be explained by assuming the existante of a peculiar film of a anomalously larde heat conductivity covering all walls that are in contact with the liquid. the pressence of the film was soon verified by Daunt and Mendelsoohn and by Kikon and Lasarew in 1938

### On Lambda-point Transition in General
Ehrenfest, considering especially the $\lambda$-transtio of liquid helium and the specific heat discontinuti of superconductors, introduced a general classification of "phase transitions of higher order". He speask of a transition of the *n*th order if the Gibbs potential $G(P, T)$ has, at the transtion line $P(T)$, a discontinuity of its *n*th partial derivatives, but not of a lower order derivative. 

The *first order transitoin* are the ordinary phase transitions with a transiton heat accompanied by a change of moler volume, both quantities being connected with the slope of the transtion curve $P(T)$ by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation $dP/dT = \Delta S/\Delta V$ where $\Delta S$ and $\Delta V$ refer to the entropy and volume difference at the transtion in question. This relation follows directly from the continuity of the Gibb potential at the transition line. 

For the *second order transitions* not only $\Delta G$ but also $\Delta S$ and $\Delta V$ are zero along the transition line. This has the consequence that $dP/dT = \Delta C_P/(TV) = \Delta\alpha_P/\Delta\chi_T$ where $C_P$ is the specified heat at constant pressure, $\alpha_P$ is the thermal expansion coefficient at constant pressure, and $\chi_T$ is the isothermal compressibility. Hence here only $C_P$, $\alpha_P$ and $\chi_P$ are discontinous. 

Similar relations can be derived for higher order transtions. Although this classification appears to be quite general, it is difficult to apply to the $\lambda$-transition of liquid helium, although it was with just this transtion in mind that the whole classification was devised. 

A glance at the specific heat curve of helium shows that the $\lambda$-anomaly does not resemble a jump; rather it appears like a peak, whose slopes assume extremely large values when approaching the maximum value of $C_P$ from higher as well as from lower temperatures. Because of this circumstance the determination of $\Delta C_P$ is somewhat uncertain. It seems to depend entirely on how close to the $\lambda$-point the measurements can be made. 

There are numerous other instances of such $\lambda$-type specific heat anomalies beside liquid helium. The thermal anomaly at the ferromagnetic Curie point of the metals of the iron group is probably the best known example.

Other examples are the specific heat singularities of certain binary alloys, e.g. $\beta$-brass (50% Zn-Cu alloy), or other substances such as methane, ammonium chloride and hycrocloric acid.

These anomalies are by no means particularly rare phenomena. Many of them are now qualitatively quite well understood. They ussually occur whenever some type of order is gradually destroyed with rising temperature, until, at some well-defined "transition temperature" the last vestige of this order disappears. 

In the Cu-Zn alloy, for instance, the order realized for low temperatures is represented by a body-centered cubic lattice in which the Cu atoms occupy the corners of the cubes, and the Zn atoms the centers, just like the Cs and Cl ions in a Cs-Cl lattice. With rising temperature, atoms of two species occassionally exchange sites; still one set of sites is at least statiscally preferred by one kind of atom. Only above 480ºC do all sites become completely equivalent, forming together a body-centered cubic lattice occupued by the Cu and Zn atoms entirely at random. In ferromagnets the order consists in an alignment of the elementary magnetic dipoles. Once started, such an alignment offers for one particular dipole orientation a lower energy than for any other one. A statistical preference is thus established for this particular orientation, which below the "Curie temperature" is able to stabilize itself against the disturbing action of the thermal motion. Similarly in ammonium chloride the occurrence of the $\lmabda$-point appears to be connected with an alignment of the orientation of the $NH_4$ tetrahedra.

## Energy and structure of condensed helium at absolute zero

Let $\phi(r)$ be the potential of the force between two molecules which may be assumed to depend only on their separation r and to be independent of the presence of other molecules. Furthermore he N molecules are supposed to be enclosed in a volume V.

Classically, the most stable state would be where particles are at rest. Presumably be closed-packed lattice. In quantum mechanics the lowest state is given by minimum of the integral 
$E=\int_V \dots \int_V \ \ \frac{h^2}{8\pi^2 m} \Sigma_a \left(\nabla_a \Psi \cdot \nabla_a \Psi^{\ast}\right) + \Phi \Psi\Psi^{\ast} \ \ d^3 r_1 \dots d^3 r_N$. For all substances except helium the following mothed leads in general to a satisfactory approximation by considering harmonic oscillations $E_{min} = \Phi_0 + \frac{h}{2}\Sigma \nu_k$ where $\nu_k$ is the frecuency of normal modes. Of course this energy can be calculated only if the spectrum is known, for which emperical data is fitted. 

It would not be sensible to calculate the characteristic vibrational modes for the volume corresponding to the classical equilibrium positions, and then to determine the zero point vibrations of those modes, if the colume of the liquid is actually so much larger. Liquid helium may be visualized as held together by the attractive forces balanced merely by the zero point repulsion ( not merely by the Van der Waals repulsion), the atoms are floating so far apart from each other thtat the repulsive forces do not interlock as in ordinary liquids. It can be foreseen that this circumstances will be importat for explaining the fact that helium cannot be solidified merely by cooling.

Keesom and Taconis moda an X-ray analysis of liquid helium. For both liquid He I and He II a pattern typical of a liquid was found; it showed a single rather diffuse ring at a difraction angle on about 28º for a wave length 1.58 $\overset\circ A$. No difference between the patterns of the two forms of the liquid could be discerned. Keesom and Taconis tried to interpret their result by a radial distribution in which every atom has six nearest neighbors at a distance of about 3.16 $\overset\circ A = 2^{-1/6}(V/N)^{1/3}$. They showed that such a distribution could be represented by a peculiar structure: imagine a facecentered cubic lattice of density double that of the liquid if all its lattice points are filled, then remove from it half of the atoms in such a way that each atom is currounded by six atoms and six empty sites. The strucutre in question is a configuration of space group $T_d^2$.
Keesom and Taconis did not suggest that liquid helium has a crystalline order, the veri diffuseness of the x-ray pattern excludes a crystal structure. But the very existence of this lattice demostrate the consistency of a radial distribution in which six first neighbours are located at a much smaller distance than cubic or close-packed lattice. 
Possibly the $T_d^2$ configuration proposed by Keesom and Taconis represents the lattice structure of lowest potential energy for the density in question. This energy is even a little lower than that of the diamond structure. 
Hence there can at best a statistical preference for the coordination number 6 at the distances of 3.16 $\overset\circ A$ because it is a very open structure with considerable mobility. 

The liquid has a smaller total energy than the solid results from the circustances that the decrease of kinetic zero point energy is more rapid than the increase of potential energy while the system expands to the largeer volume.

The molar volume is expanded to such an extent that it allows only a very open strucutre with at least as many interstitial spaces as atoms. In this line of thought, Frohlich propoused that liquid helium be considered a binary alloy consisting of N atoms and N holes. This interpreation implicitly takes it for grauted that the occupied sites have somewhat lower energy than those which are supposed to be empty. However, just the contrary is true. Consequently no order-disorder transition favoring on set of sites can be expected on this basis. A statistical strucutre in which each of the 2N sites is assumed to be indiscriminately ocuppied (quantum-mechanical statistical sense) certainly have lower energy. Firstly, because lower potential energy on average three second neighbors in six previously supposed to be empty. And secondly, the increase on occupied space per atom

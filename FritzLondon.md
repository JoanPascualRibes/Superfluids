# SUPERFLUIDS: Fritz London

## Introduction: Superfluid 
According to classical theory, at sufficiently low temperatures, any system composed of identical particles confined to a given volume should come to rest.

According to quantum theory, the most stable state of any system is a kind of kinetic equilibrium for so-called zero point motion characterized by the minimum average 
Total (potential + kinetic) energy under the supplementary connection of Heisemberg inequality.

The existence of superfluid and in particular the strange transfer mechanism they exhibit are direct indications that they represent macroscopic system for which the classical 
theory is incompetent and that presumably quantum mechanisms are relevant to their constitution as a whole.

In 1924 Einstein, generalizing the ideas of the Indian physics Bose, developed the concept of a gas of identical molecules where two cases of A here B there and A there B here 
Are indistinguishable and one single case indeed. Theis preference would least, at a well-defined temperature, to a kind of change of state of aggregation where the molecules 
Would "condese" into the lowest quantum state, the state of momentum zero.

Manifested by a breaking in the specific heat curve $C_{V}$ at a well-defined "critical temperature $T_ {0} $. At this temperature, the mean thermal (kinetic) energy becomes so 
small that the mean deBroglie wavelength $\lambda = h/p$ assumes a value of the order of the minimum molecular distance. When the temperature is lowered below this critical 
temperature $T_0$ the velocity distribution becomes inhomogeneous. A finite fraction of all molecules are assembled in the lowest quantum state (p=0) and accordingly has a 
microscopically large deBroglie wave length while the rest of the molecules have a velocity distribution similar to that of a gas. The fraction of molecules in the lowerst 
state increases with decreasing temperature until, at 0º absolute, all molecules are assembled in this particular state.

In superconductors as well as in superfluid helium, we enconter an equilibrium between two fluids which mutually interpenetrate in ordinary space but are in general separated 
in momentum space. 

It has been maintained that certain actions between macromolecules in biochemistry could not be undesetood unless could be conceived as conditioned by some quantum mechanism 
involving the system as a whole. Of course it is conceivable that in some biological process the concept of a fluid state of entropy zero could play a decisive role, because 
the quantum phenomena gives the possibility of stability with the possibility of motion without implying dissipation process.

# Remarkable properties of liquid helium.

In 1908 Kamerlingh Onnes liquefied helium (critical temperature 5.2ºK). He found that when the liquid is cooled below 2.2ºK it starts expanding insted of continuing to contract,
thus deviating from the behaviour of more substances.
In 1924 Onnes and Boks found that the density-temperature funciton has a sharp maximum with a discontinuty of its slope at that temperature. 
In 1928 Keeson and Wolke were first to use terminology "helium I" and "helium II" suggesting the idea of a kind of allotropic modification. In contrast to ordinary phase transitions,
the transition from He II to He I is not accompanied by a latent heat.
In 1932 Specific heat measurements by Keesom and Clusius showed a singularity of the specific heat curve whose characteristic profile, resembling the shape of the letter lambda,
has given rise to the name $\lambda$-point. Lambda-point occur in many substances and are characterized by vanishing latent heat and the above-mentioned sort of singulariry of 
specific heat.

The most conspicuos pecularity of the diagram on P-T plane is the absence of a triple point between the solid, liquid and gaseous states. Instead are actually two triple points, at the ends of the $\lambda$-line which separates liquid He I from He II. Another pecularity is that melting curve seem to approach T = 0 at a pressure of about 25 atm.

From the Clausius-Clapeyron equation $dP_m / dT =(S_{liq}-S_{sol})/(V_{liq}-V_{sol})$ where $P_m$ is the melting pressure curve, it follow that at 1ºK the entropy of the liquid must be practicall equal to entropy of the solid. Hence it seem as if between 2.2ºK and 1ºK liquid helium loses all entropy characteristic of the disorder of the ordinary liquid state.

$\Delta U = T \Delta S - P_m \Delta V \qquad \Delta S = (dP_m/dT)\Delta V \quad \implies \quad \Delta U = T \left( dP_m / dT - P_m/T \right) \Delta V$ Which Implies if a point on the melting-pressure curve tangent can be drawn from $P=0$ $T=0$ $\left( \therefore \ dP_m / dT = P_m / T \right)$, the energy difference must change sign at the temperature of point of contact. For no other substance can such a tangent be contructed because ordinarily melting or sublimation curves start at 0ºK and are always convex toward the T axis. This means in general solid state is state of lowest energy.

Solid helium cannot be melted isothermally by supplying heat to the system, since there is no heat of mealting. Close to absolute zero, solidificaciotn and melting are purely mechanical processes. No entropy change is involved in this trancition. At absolute zero, where the system is in its lowest (single) quantum state, melting must then consist in an adiabatic transformation of this quantum state.
Even at finite temperatures, at which liquid helium II has some entropy, there is a very peculiar transfoer process by which at least a part of the liquid can slip through the finest cracks and extremely narrow slits and capillaries, which for normal liquids are, in effect, impassable. 

Liquid helium can overcome obstacles freely even without requiring a noticeable preassure difference and it seems to leave its entropy behind. The fact that no entropy transfer in connected with the superfluid flow clearly indicates that no entropy transfer is connected with the superfluid flow clearly indicates that this flow is again a purely mechanical process. It appears then as if actually is this superfluid transfer process a single quantum state is adiabatically so transformed as to pass through the capillaries.

## The "Super" properties of liquid helium II 

* **Thermal Superconductivity**
In 1936 Keesom and Miss Keesom noticed an enormous increase of heat exchange as liquid helium passes through the $\lambda$-point. 1937 Allen, Peierls and Uddin first noticed that the heat current is liquid helium II is not proportional to the temperature gradient (violating the Fourier Law). At any rate the heat current depend on the slit width in a way that rules out a description by a heat conductivity equation.
* **Superfluidity**
In 1930 Keesom and Van der Ende observed quite accidentally that liquid helium II passed with very annoying ease through ceration extremely small leaks which at a higher temperature were perfectly tight for liquid helium I and even for gaseous helium. In 1938 Keesom and Macwood measured the viscosity with the rotationg disk method and showed that the viscosity varies continuously, decreases with decreasing temperature quite considerably, and is certainly not very different from the viscosity of helium I. In 1938 Kapitza (and independetly Allen and Misener 1938) reported measuremets based on the capillary flow method which showed the viscosity of liquid helium dropping by many orders of magnitude to an immeasurably small value. These experiments certainly did not indicate the presence of a viscous, laminar or turbulnet flow. They cannot be discussed on the basis of the ordinary differential equation of hydrodynamics. 
* **The fountain effect**
In 1938 Allen and Jones study heat conductivity with a reservoir and a smaller vessel, both filled with liquid helium and connected by a fine capillary. When they supplied heat to the inner vessel, they observed that the inner helium level rose slightly above that of the reservoir. In one of their experiments thay used a tube with its lower end filled with emery powder. When they heated the powder by the radiation of a flashlight, they observed a jet of liquid helium rising from the upper end to a height of several centimeters. It seems impossible to treat the hydrodynamical and caloric properties of liquid helium independently, because even extremely small temperature differences between bath and inner vessel are sufficient to produce a very large convection.

* **Supersurface film**
In 1922 Onnes observed a transfer at a striking speed of helium from one vessel to the other until the levels is two containers had reached the same heigth. In 1939 Pollin and Simon observed that the rate of evaporation of liquid contained in a vessel increased suddenly when the temperature is lowered below $\lambda$-point. They suggested that this migth be explained by assuming the existante of a peculiar film of a anomalously larde heat conductivity covering all walls that are in contact with the liquid. the pressence of the film was soon verified by Daunt and Mendelsoohn and by Kikon and Lasarew in 1938.

### On Lambda-point Transition in General
Ehrenfest, considering especially the $\lambda$-transtio of liquid helium and the specific heat discontinuti of superconductors, introduced a general classification of "phase transitions of higher order". He speask of a transition of the *n*th order if the Gibbs potential $G(P, T)$ has, at the transtion line $P(T)$, a discontinuity of its *n*th partial derivatives, but not of a lower order derivative. 

The *first order transitoin* are the ordinary phase transitions with a transiton heat accompanied by a change of moler volume, both quantities being connected with the slope of the transtion curve $P(T)$ by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation $dP/dT = \Delta S/\Delta V$ where $\Delta S$ and $\Delta V$ refer to the entropy and volume difference at the transtion in question. This relation follows directly from the continuity of the Gibb potential at the transition line. 

For the *second order transitions* not only $\Delta G$ but also $\Delta S$ and $\Delta V$ are zero along the transition line. This has the consequence that $dP/dT = \Delta C_P/(TV) = \Delta\alpha_P/\Delta\chi_T$ where $C_P$ is the specified heat at constant pressure, $\alpha_P$ is the thermal expansion coefficient at constant pressure, and $\chi_T$ is the isothermal compressibility. Hence here only $C_P$, $\alpha_P$ and $\chi_P$ are discontinous. 

Similar relations can be derived for higher order transtions. Although this classification appears to be quite general, it is difficult to apply to the $\lambda$-transition of liquid helium, although it was with just this transtion in mind that the whole classification was devised. 

A glance at the specific heat curve of helium shows that the $\lambda$-anomaly does not resemble a jump; rather it appears like a peak, whose slopes assume extremely large values when approaching the maximum value of $C_P$ from higher as well as from lower temperatures. Because of this circumstance the determination of $\Delta C_P$ is somewhat uncertain. It seems to depend entirely on how close to the $\lambda$-point the measurements can be made. 

There are numerous other instances of such $\lambda$-type specific heat anomalies beside liquid helium. The thermal anomaly at the ferromagnetic Curie point of the metals of the iron group is probably the best known example. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12723744-613b-49a3-9121-66a69407fb72" width="500" height="500"> 

Other examples are the specific heat singularities of certain binary alloys, e.g. $\beta$-brass (50% Zn-Cu alloy), or other substances such as methane, ammonium chloride and hycrocloric acid.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3aa0721c-ff4c-4acc-9121-1703e00d8c6e)

These anomalies are by no means particularly rare phenomena. Many of them are now qualitatively quite well understood. They ussually occur whenever some type of order is gradually destroyed with rising temperature, until, at some well-defined "transition temperature" the last vestige of this order disappears. 

In the Cu-Zn alloy, for instance, the order realized for low temperatures is represented by a body-centered cubic lattice in which the Cu atoms occupy the corners of the cubes, and the Zn atoms the centers, just like the Cs and Cl ions in a Cs-Cl lattice. With rising temperature, atoms of two species occassionally exchange sites; still one set of sites is at least statiscally preferred by one kind of atom. Only above 480ºC do all sites become completely equivalent, forming together a body-centered cubic lattice occupued by the Cu and Zn atoms entirely at random. In ferromagnets the order consists in an alignment of the elementary magnetic dipoles. Once started, such an alignment offers for one particular dipole orientation a lower energy than for any other one. A statistical preference is thus established for this particular orientation, which below the "Curie temperature" is able to stabilize itself against the disturbing action of the thermal motion. Similarly in ammonium chloride the occurrence of the $\lambda$-point appears to be connected with an alignment of the orientation of the $NH_4$ tetrahedra.

These "order-disorder" mechanisms present a very simple qualitaive interpretation of a great number of know specific heat singularities, an interpretation which in some cases can be directly supported by x-ray analysis. However, the development of a rigorous statistical theory of mechanisms of this tyoe is so very difficult that so far it has been possible to make progress only at the price of drastic simplifications. Of particular interest is the quation of the kind of specific heat anomaly implied by the theory. Un fortunately the answer depends to a great extend on tje simplifications made. 

Although the rigorous theory of $\lambda$-points is still far from being complete, there is no doubt that a great number of them can be qualitatively interpreted as order-disorder transitions. This has led to the belief that every $\lambda$-type anomaly of the specific heat has to be interpreted as an order-disorder transition. However, the classical example of the $\lambda$-point of liquid helium does not seem to admit an explanation in terms of any mechanism of this kind; the helium atoms are just too symmetrical to archieve an order-disorder transition, say, by virtue of an orientation like that of the $NH_4$ tetrahedra of the ferromagnetic dipole alignment. Nor can a pute substaces like helium establish anything like the type or order of binary alloys. Liquid helium seems to be too simple to have a $\lambda$-point! Indeed, it musy be a particular kind of ordering process by which liquid helium cooled below 2.19ºK rapidly loses all its entropy of liquid disorder without going into the solid state. The expression "liquid degeneracy" has been suggersted to give a name to this mysterious process. The mere naming of it, however, only served to emphasize the mystery. 

# Energy and structure of condensed helium at absolute zero

Let $\phi(r)$ be the potential of the force between two molecules which may be assumed to depend only on their separation r and to be independent of the presence of other molecules. Furthermore he N molecules are supposed to be enclosed in a volume V.

Classically, the most stable state would be where particles are at rest. Presumably be closed-packed lattice. In quantum mechanics the lowest state is given by minimum of the integral 
$E=\int_V \dots \int_V \ \ \frac{h^2}{8\pi^2 m} \Sigma_a \left(\nabla_a \Psi \cdot \nabla_a \Psi^{\ast}\right) + \Phi \Psi\Psi^{\ast} \ \ d^3 r_1 \dots d^3 r_N$. For all substances except helium the following mothed leads in general to a satisfactory approximation by considering harmonic oscillations $E_{min} = \Phi_0 + \frac{h}{2}\Sigma \nu_k$ where $\nu_k$ is the frecuency of normal modes. Of course this energy can be calculated only if the spectrum is known, for which emperical data is fitted. 

It would not be sensible to calculate the characteristic vibrational modes for the volume corresponding to the classical equilibrium positions, and then to determine the zero point vibrations of those modes, if the colume of the liquid is actually so much larger. Liquid helium may be visualized as held together by the attractive forces balanced merely by the zero point repulsion ( not merely by the Van der Waals repulsion), the atoms are floating so far apart from each other thtat the repulsive forces do not interlock as in ordinary liquids. It can be foreseen that this circumstances will be importat for explaining the fact that helium cannot be solidified merely by cooling.

Keesom and Taconis moda an X-ray analysis of liquid helium. For both liquid He I and He II a pattern typical of a liquid was found; it showed a single rather diffuse ring at a difraction angle on about 28º for a wave length 1.58 $\overset\circ A$. No difference between the patterns of the two forms of the liquid could be discerned. Keesom and Taconis tried to interpret their result by a radial distribution in which every atom has six nearest neighbors at a distance of about 3.16 $\overset\circ A = 2^{-1/6}(V/N)^{1/3}$. They showed that such a distribution could be represented by a peculiar structure: imagine a facecentered cubic lattice of density double that of the liquid if all its lattice points are filled, then remove from it half of the atoms in such a way that each atom is currounded by six atoms and six empty sites. The strucutre in question is a configuration of space group $T_d^2$.
Keesom and Taconis did not suggest that liquid helium has a crystalline order, the veri diffuseness of the x-ray pattern excludes a crystal structure. But the very existence of this lattice demostrate the consistency of a radial distribution in which six first neighbours are located at a much smaller distance than cubic or close-packed lattice. 
Possibly the $T_d^2$ configuration proposed by Keesom and Taconis represents the lattice structure of lowest potential energy for the density in question. This energy is even a little lower than that of the diamond structure. 
Hence there can at best a statistical preference for the coordination number 6 at the distances of 3.16 $\overset\circ A$ because it is a very open structure with considerable mobility. 

The liquid has a smaller total energy than the solid results from the circustances that the decrease of kinetic zero point energy is more rapid than the increase of potential energy while the system expands to the larger volume.
The molar volume is expanded to such an extent that it allows only a very open strucutre with at least as many interstitial spaces as atoms. 

In this line of thought, Frohlich propoused that liquid helium be considered a binary alloy consisting of N atoms and N holes. Above the $\lambda$-point the atoms and holes would be distributed at random over the 2N sites, whereas below the $\lambda$ temperature the atoms would statistically prefer a certaion subset of N sites. Thus the mechanism would be quite analogous to the order-disorder transition in $\beta$-brass. This interpreation implicitly takes it for granted that the occupied sites have somewhat lower energy than those which are supposed to be empty. However, it is easy yo see that just the contrary is true. The supposedly empty sites would actually have lower potential energy because, besides having six closest neighbors at the same distance, as the occupied sites do, the holes would have six second neighbors in addition. These additional second neighbors do noticeably lower the potentail energy of the empty sites. Consequently no order-disorder transition favoring on set of sites can be expected on this basis.

A statistical strucutre in which each of the 2N sites is assumed to be indiscriminately ocuppied (quantum-mechanical statistical sense) - each with the probability 1/2 - would certainly have lower energy. Firstly, because the lower potential energy would be lowered by the presence of, on the average, three second neighbors in six previously supposed to be empty. And secondly, at the same time the kinetic zero point energy could also be lowered because the increase of occupied space per atom means a larger $\Delta x$ and hence, a smaller minimum average momentum square and consequently a smaller kinetic zero point energy.

This discussion if of course insufficient to derive any particular strucutre. But certainly it rules out the lattice strucutre in qustion as group state and moreover it cast sufficiente doubt about the possibility of any periodic structure providing N sites of minimum potential for N atoms. In this way we may understand why under normal pressure helium does not become a crystal by mere cooling. As well as why in the liquid state there is at least a statistical preference for a radical distribution inwhich each atom is surronded by six closest neighbors ar a distance of about 3.16 $\overset\circ A$.

Yet this system does not represent a liquid in the ordinaty sense. There are no potential barriers as in ordinary liquid to overcome when an external stress is applied. In this respect there seem to be a greater similarity to a gas than we are used to assume in ordinary liquids. This view is supperted by the extremely significant fat that liquid helium I, which on first sight appears to be quite an ordinary viscous liquid, actually has a visosity of a type ordinarily found only in gases and not in liquids.

In ordinary liquids the momentum transport proceeds over obstacles presumably formed by the interlocking force filed of neighboring molecules. This can be derived from the fact that the viscosity of normal liquids has a large negative temperature coefficient, indicating that the passage of molecules between their neighbors is greatly aided by thermal excitation.
$\eta_{liquid} \sim e^{A/RT}$ where A is activation energy (Andrade, Eyring). This liquid-type or dynamic viscosity is characteristically different from the gas-type or kinetic viscosity. In a gas the transport of momentum proceeds unhindered over the mean free path. It is proportional to the average momentum varried by the molecules and is given by the well-known formula of the kinetic theory of gases: $\eta_{gas} \sim \rho \overline{\nu} l \sim \sqrt{T}$ where $\overline{\nu} =$ averagemolecular velocity, $l=$ mean free path, $\rho=$ density. According to this formula the viscosiry of a gas increases with temperature. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f9f192e-1d5f-459d-9385-764f1520fb39)

As shown in the figure, the temperature coefficient of liquid He I is clearly positive and, hence, of the type usually shown only by gases. The viscosity of the liquid is only about three times as large as that vapor, although its density is larger by a factor of 800: $\eta_{He gas} = 0.8\times 10^{-5} poise \quad \eta_{He I} = 2.5\times 10^{-5} poise$.
This observation suggest an approah to the theory of liquid helium from a point of departure which unites characteristics of a gas with those of a liquid.  
Because of this exceptional large molar volume, liquid helium under low pressure might reasonably be contemplated from a point of view that emphasizes, more than in usual with other liquids, a dimilarity to a gas. Only under sufficiently high pressure does liquid helium I behave like an ordinary liquid. 

As conclusion, so far we have failed to discover any evidence in favor of a state of order that could explain the $\lambda$-transition of liquid helium. We have rather come to the negative results that condensed helium under zero pressure cannot maintain any structure ordered in space. Also, we found the prevalence of a tendenecy in just the opposite direction. We saw that helium atoms can gain energy by dispersing in space. A striking manifestatio of this tendency can be seen in the strange but most significant fact that when liquid helium is cooled below the $\lambda$-point it is expanding its volume just at the same time when it is losing most of its entropy. We may wonder whether this system if is can not gain stability by improving its space order, might not take advantage of this situation when approaching absolute zero and might, as a manifestation of quantum-mechanical complementarity, settle in some kind of order in momentum space even at the expanse of order in ordinary space. 

# The evolution of the two-fluid concept
## The ideal Bose-Einstein Gas

Fermi-Dirac gas settles down when approaching 0ºK in a kind of lattice order in momentum space. Bose-Einstein by crowding all molecules into the state of smallest momentum. Ideal Fermi-Dirac gas the transition proceeds continuously, for ideal Vose-Einstein gas ths transition is accompained by characteristic thermal discontinuity at $T_e = \frac{h^2}{2\pi m k}\left(\frac{N}{2.612 V}\right)^{2/3}$ where the specific heat $C_V$ of the Bose-Einstein gas has a peak. Below this temperature a finite fraction of all molecules goes into the lowerest state, the state of momentum zero. The number of molecules in the ground state from total N molecules is $n_0=N \left[ 1-\left(\frac{T}{T_c}\right)^{2/3}\right]$ for $T<T_c$ whereas for $T>T_c$ $n_0$ is only of the order of 1. This peculiar process may be described as a gradual condensation starting at $T=T_c$ and being completed as 0ºK, though it is characteristically different from an ordinary condensation in that is this transition there is no phase separation in space. Instead, since the momentum distribution is divided into two branches, it may be said that there is a kind of phase separation in momentum space, the two phases being represented by the "condensed" phase of the $n_0$ molecules in the ground state (infinite density) and by the "uncondensed" phase in which the remaining $N-n_0 = N(T/T_c)^{3/2}$ molecules are distributed with density over the excited states. The condensed phase consisting of molecules of zero momentum or of a macroscopic deBroglie wavelength represents a remarkable example of a quantum mechanism of macroscopic scale. This condensation characteristic of Bose-Einstein statistics is a peculiar example of an order-disorder transition. 

### Constant Volume
It is well know that the general assumptions of Bose-Einstein statistics lead, the average number $n_i$ of molecules in an energy level $\epsilon_i$ of satistical weight $g_i$ is 
$n_i = \frac{g_i}{e^{\epsilon_i /k T + \alpha} -1}$ where $\alpha$ is determined as a function on N and T considering $\Sigma_i n_i = N$

If $n_i$ varies sufficiently smoothly, we have: $g(\epsilon) = \lim_{\Delta \epsilon \rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{\Delta \epsilon} \Sigma_{\epsilon_i = \epsilon}^{\epsilon+\Delta\epsilon} g_i$. Thus $g(\epsilon)d\epsilon$ gives the number of energy levels in the interval $(\epsilon, \epsilon+d\epsilon)$.

The molecules of an ideal monoatomic gas enclosed within a cubic volume V have the energy spectrum $\epsilon_{k,l,n} = \frac{h^2}{2 m}V^{-2/3}(k^2+l^2+n^2). Assuming cyclic boundary conditions, implying that k,l,n may take any set of integer values. This spectrum can be represented by the smoothed weight function $g(\epsilon) = \frac{2\pi V}{h^3}(2m)^{3/2}\epsilon^{1/2}$

Therefore, $N = \Sigma n_i = \frac{2\pi V}{h^3}(2m)^{3/2} \int_0^{\infty} \frac{\sqrt{\epsilon} d\epsilon}{e^{\epsilon_i /k T + \alpha} -1} = V \left( \frac{2\pi m k T}{h^2} \right)^{3/2} F_{3/2}(\alpha) \qquad F_{\sigma}(\alpha) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(\sigma)} \int_0^{\infty} \frac{y^{\sigma-1} dy}{e^{y+\alpha}-1} = \Sigma_{n=1}^{\infty} n^{-\sigma}e^{-n\alpha}$. Notice that calculation of N only non-negative values of $\alpha$ are permissible since a negative $\alpha$ would imply a negative $n_0$, which does not make sense. On the other hand, the function $F_{3/2}(\alpha)$ has a finite maximum value $\zeta(3/2)=2.612$ at $\alpha=0$, from which it decreases monotonically. Hence $\nexists \alpha \geq 0$ which fulfills the calculation of N if $N > N_c = \zeta(3/2) V \left( \frac{2\pi m k T}{h^2} \right)^{3/2} \ \iff \ T < T_c = \frac{h^2}{2\pi m k} \left( \frac{N}{\zeta(3/2)V} \right) \ \iff \ V/N < \nu_c = \frac{1}{\zeta(3/2)}  \left( \frac{h^2}{2\pi m k T} \right)^{3/2}$. 

This difficultry does not occur in the original sum $\Sigma n_i = N$. According first equation the lowest energy k=l=n=0 is occupied by $n_0=\frac{1}{e^{\alpha}-1} molecules, which can be made as large as desired with sufficiently small positive $\alpha$. Let's see that this term is omitted in the integral because $g(0)=0$ whereas actually $g_0=1$. 
$N = \frac{1}{e^{\alpha}-1} + N \left( \frac{T}{T_c} \right)^{3/2} \frac{F_{3/2}(\alpha)}{F_{3/2}(0)}$. 

By this relation and some several aproximations, we find that the limit as $N\rightarrow \infty$ but $N/V$ finite, for which tje thermodynamical functions are actually defined, the ratio $n_0/N$ considered a function of T consists of two different analytical branches, one for $T<T_c \ lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}(n_0/N) = 1-(T/T_c)^{3/2} \quad T>T_c \ lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}(n_0/N) = 0$. The same holds for all thermodynamical functios whether they are referred to a mole or to the unit volume: they consist of two different analytical branches, one for $T<T_c$ and the other for $T>T_c$. For the calculation of the energy a special consideration concerning the contribution of the ground state is unnecessaty because the ground state does not constribute to the energy $(\epsilon_0 = 0). $E = \Sigma_i n_i\epsilon_i = 2\pi V (2m/h^2)^{3/2} \int_0^{\infty} \frac{\epsilon^{3/2} d\epsilon}{e^{\epsilon/kT +\alpha}-1} = 3/2 V k T \left( \frac{2\pi m k T}{h^2} \right)^{3/2} F_{5/2}(\alpha)$. For $T<T_c$ we may simply let $\alpha=0 \quad E_{-} = 3/2 R T \left( \frac{T}{T_c} \right)^{3/2} \frac{\zeta(5/2)}{\zeta(3/2)}$. For $T>T_c$ we have to eliminate $\alpha$ considering $F_{3/2} = \zeta(3/2) (T_c/T)^{3/2}$ as finite positive $\alpha$ makes the contribution of $(e^{\alpha}-1)^{-1}$ small compared with N, therefore $E_{+} = 3/2 R T \frac{F_{5/2}(\alpha)}{F_{3/2}(\alpha)}. 

Extending the calculation to different thermodynamic magnitudes, we find $\Delta\left(\frac{\partial C_V}{\partial T}\right) = lim_{T\rightarrow T_c} 
\left(\frac{\partial C_{V-}}{\partial T}\right)_ V - \left(\frac{\partial C_{V+}}{\partial T}\right)_V = \frac{27}{16\pi} [\zeta(3/2)]^2 \frac{R}{T_c}$.

###Constant Pressure 

So far, supposing that we had a gas in a box, we have considered that the volume V constant. Under these conditions the specific heat is continuous but has a discontinuous derivative with respect to T. This does not mean that the transition of the ideal Bose-Einstein gas is a third order transition. To decide the question of the order of the transition we must not prescribe the volume. We have rather to use pressure and temperatue as independent variables. From the independence of P of volume it directly follows that the condensation is actually a first order transtion with a transtion line in the P-T plane given by $P_c(T) = P_{-} = kT ( 2\pi m k T /h^2)^{3/2} \zeta(5/2) \quad$ (this comes from the thermodynamic calculations). Indeed, for pressure larger that this critical pressure the volume of the gas collapses to the volume zero ($V_{+} = 0$), which means the volume changes by $\Delta V = V_{-} - V_{+} = N \nu_c = \left( \frac{h^2}{2\pi m k T} \right)^{3/2} \frac{N}{\zeta(3/2)}$. The transition heat $Q = T_c \Delta S = 5/2 R T_c \frac{\zeta(5/2)}{\zeta(3/2)}$. Evidentl the Clausius-Clapeyron equation is satisfied $\frac{dP_c}{dT} = 5/2 k \left( \frac{2\pi m k T}{h^2} \right)^{3/2} \zeta(5/2) = \frac{\Delta S}{\Delta V} = \frac{S_c}{V_c}$ as it has to be for a first order transition.

Let us now calculate the specific heat at constante pressure. Since for the ideal gas $PV = 2/3 E$, the enthalpy $H = E+PV = 5/3 E = 5/2 RT\frac{F_{5/2}(\alpha)}{F_{3/2}(\alpha)}$. Accordingly the specific heat at constant pressure is given by $C_P = \left( \frac{\partial H}{\partial T} \right)_ P = \frac{5}{2} R \left( \frac{5}{2}\frac{F_{5/2}^2 F_{1/2}}{F_{3/2}^3} - \frac{3}{2}\frac{F_{5/2}}{F_{3/2}} \right)$ which becomes infinite when the temperatute approaches $T_c$ because $F_{1/2}(\alpha) \rightarrow \sqrt{\pi/\alpha} for small $\alpha$. This is very different from the specific heat a t constant volume, which is finite for all temperatures.

### Energy Spectrum with a Gap

Various attempts have been made to modify the energy spectrum of the ideal Bose-Einstein gas in such a way as to fit the thermal data of liquid helium. The conclusion drown from these attempts is that something as drastic as an energy gap is required. Consider the energy spectrum $\epsilon_{0,0,0} =  0 \quad \epsilon_{k,l,n} = \Delta + \frac{h^2}{2m*}(k^2+l^2+n^2) V^{-2/3}$ otherwise. With this correction we repeat the termodynamic calculations. It is of interest to notice that we obtain a discontinuity in the specific heat curve (not only in the slope). This discontinuity essentially follows from the Bose-Einstein stadistics rather than from the assumption of a gap. For Fermi-Dirac or Boltzman stadistics no discontinuity would result even if energy gap were assumed.

## Smoothed potential Model of a Bose-Einstein Liquid
A stadistical theory of the liquid state must consider the inderaction forces, of course. This is a extremely difficult task. So far it has been much more expedient to try to study the liquid state by means of simplified models rather that by more or less systematic approsimation methods. Probably the simplest model of liquid is the so-called "smoothed potential" model of Guggenheim. 

The main characteristic by which a liquid is distinguished from a gas is that volume depends relatively little on temperature and pressure and is roughly defined by the size of the container. The smoothed potential model simplifies the liquid state to the point that is guarantees the liquid volume by replaciong the 3N dimensional potential funciton of the interaction forces of N molecules by a suitably chosen average, the smoothed potentail $N \chi(V/N)$, a function depending on the molar volume only and showing a definite minimum for a certain value of V/N. Energy of each molecule is assumed to be $\epsilon_{k,l,n} = \chi(V/N) + (k^2+l^2+n^2)\frac{h^2}{2m} V^{-2/3}. This is a very crude way of disposing. Yet this method is a useful device, illustrating and connecting numerous properties of liquid state, and it can be refined in many ways. 

For liquid helium we found it necessary to take account of the large contribution of the kinetic zero point energy $K_0$ in order to determine the total energy and volume at 0ºK $E = E_{id} + N\chi(V/N)$ where $E_{id}$ is ideal Bose-Einstein liquid's energy previously seen. $\left( \frac{\partial E}{\partial T} \right)_ V = C_V = C_{idx} \quad A = -T \int_0^{T}E/T^2 dT$ for constant V $\implies A = A_{id}+N\chi(V/N) \implies -\left( \frac{\partial A}{\partial T} \right)_ V = S = S_{idx} \quad P = -\left( \frac{\partial A}{\partial V} \right)_ T = P_{id} - \chi '(V/N)$ is no longer independent of the volume for $T<T_c$. 

For thermodynamics, its follows: $C_P - C_V = -T \frac{(\partial P /\partial T)_ V^2}{(\partial P /\partial V)_ T} \implies C_P = C_V -T \frac{(\partial P_{id} /\partial T)_ V^2}{(\partial P_{id} /\partial V)_ T - \chi''/N}$. $C_V$ is continuous with discontinuous slope at $T = T_c$, the same holds for $C_P$ because $(\partial P_{id} /\partial V)_ T$ and (\partial P_{id} /\partial T)_ V are continuous. According to this model we get a third order transition P-T plane. Whereas the ideal Bose-Einstein gas has a first order transition.

# The Two Fluid Model of Liquid Helium II
For ideal Bose-Einstein liquid $T_c$ = 3.13ºK and S(2.19ºK) = 0.77R, whereas for liquid helium $T_{\lambda}$ = 2.19ºK and $S_{\lambda}$ = 0.8R. Noticing this correspondence to the orders of magnitude, the hypothesis that the transition of liquid He I into He II might be caused by the condensation mechanism of the degenerating Bose-Einstein gas, with due allowance for the presence of intermolecular forces and for the circumstance that we are dealing with the liquid and not with the gaseous state. The transfer of matter which might rather be the result of and adiabatic transformation of an isolated ground state, the adiabatic parameters being varied by manipulating the macroscopic boundary conditions. The idea of applyign results of the ideal gas theory to the liquid state appeared at first sight somewhat daring. Yet for liquid helium the gas picture is probably not quite so unrealistic. Before, we showed that in liquid helium the zero point motion has an unssually large effect on the strucutre, inflating the volume of the liquid to a value almost three times as large as would correspond to the "classical" van der Waals volume. We pointed to the fact that viscosity of He I shows a positive temperature coefficient like that of a gas. An understanding of a great number of the most striking peculiarities of liquid helium can be achived, with out entering into any discussion of details of molecular mechanisms, merely on the hypothesis that some of the general features of the degeearing ideal Bose-Einstein gas remain intact, at least qualitatively, for this liquid, which has a extremely open strucutre. 

It was Tisza who first recognized the possibility of evading the pitfalls of a rigorous molecular-kinetic theory by employing the qualitative properties of such Bose-Einstein gas. The so-called two-fluid theory is based on the following assumptions (which are borrowed from the Bose-Einstein condensation)
